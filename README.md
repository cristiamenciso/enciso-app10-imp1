Hello, Welcome to my to do list application. The list view starts out blank so begin by adding a new item to the list. This is done by entering the name of the item on the left text field and choosing a date from the date picker. Once the fielda are full click on add item to populate item to list. It is possible to add an item without a date. 

Items in list can be modified by double clicking on their respective cell. Press the 'enter' key to set the value. 

To delete an item from the list, simply click on an item to highlight it. Once highlighted click on the remove item button to remove the selected item from the list. To delete all items from the list click 'remove all'. 

As of this current iterration the load/save functionality has yet to be implemented. The list can currently only be viewed in completion and without filters.

To view in sorted order click on the column headers to sort.
